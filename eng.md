### 1. Repository Setup
*   Initialized repository `ronithryal/ocap-council`.

### 2. Prompt Architecture
*   Added `brockman.md` to define the "Brockman Formula" for hydration.
*   Updated `stack.md` to link the hydration phase to the o1-prompting methodology.

### 3. Infrastructure Research
*   Evaluated Privy, Coinbase Embedded Wallets, Dynamic, and Turnkey for the settlement layer.
*   **Pivot:** Considering **Coinbase Embedded Wallets** for Base-native scalability (pay-per-op) or **Turnkey** for autonomous agent signing.
